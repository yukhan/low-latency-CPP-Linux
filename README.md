# low-latency-CPP-Linux
When it comes to building low-latency systems using C++ and Linux, several essential components contribute to achieving optimal performance. Here are some key considerations: Low latency CPP/Linux will dive into low latency techniques used in C++ and Linux.I will create a curated list of C++ and Linux low-latency features, which will then be supported by a detailed blog post.
