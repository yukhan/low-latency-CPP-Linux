# C++ and Linux techniques for low latency systems
Low latency CPP/Linux will dive into low latency techniques used in C++ and Linux.I will create a curated list of C++ and Linux low-latency features, which will then be supported by a detailed blog post.

When it comes to building low-latency systems using C++ and Linux, several essential components contribute to achieving optimal performance. Here are some key considerations:

Kernel Tuning: Fine-tuning the Linux kernel parameters can significantly impact latency. Parameters like timer frequency, interrupt handling, and scheduling policies can be adjusted to minimize latency.

Real-Time Extensions: Linux offers real-time extensions like the PREEMPT-RT patch, which provides deterministic scheduling and reduces latency. It allows critical tasks to preempt non-critical ones, ensuring time-sensitive operations are not delayed.

Lock-Free Data Structures: Synchronization mechanisms like locks or mutexes can introduce latency due to contention. By using lock-free data structures, such as atomic operations, you can minimize contention and reduce latency.

Memory Management: Efficient memory management is crucial for reducing latency. Consider using memory pools or custom allocators to minimize dynamic memory allocation and deallocation overhead.

Compiler Optimizations: Modern C++ compilers provide various optimization flags that can significantly impact latency. Enabling aggressive optimizations like loop unrolling, inlining, and optimizing for specific CPU architectures can improve performance.

Low-Latency Networking: If your system involves network communication, using efficient networking libraries like libevent or libuv can help minimize latency. These libraries offer asynchronous event-driven models that avoid blocking and reduce latency.

Profiling and Benchmarking: Profiling tools help identify performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization. Tools like perf or gperftools can provide valuable insights into system behavior and guide optimizations.

Hardware Considerations: The hardware platform plays a crucial role in achieving low latency. Factors such as CPU speed, cache size, memory bandwidth, and network interface can affect overall performance.

Remember that low-latency systems require a holistic approach involving software, hardware, and system configuration optimizations. Fine-tuning and benchmarking are necessary to achieve the best results for your specific use case.

# C++ features to avoid in low latency systems
Dynamic Memory Allocation: Frequent dynamic memory allocation and deallocation using new and delete can introduce non-deterministic behavior and increase latency. 

Virtual Functions: The use of virtual functions can introduce indirection and impact performance due to runtime polymorphism.

Exception Handling: Exceptions can introduce overhead and unpredictable control flow, which can be undesirable in low-latency systems. 

Run-Time Type Information (RTTI): RTTI allows runtime type identification and dynamic casting, but it comes with performance overhead.

Standard Template Library (STL): While the STL provides powerful and convenient data structures and algorithms, certain operations, like resizing containers or complex iterator operations, can have non-deterministic behavior and introduce latency.

Excessive Object Copying: Frequent object copying, especially for large or complex objects, can lead to unnecessary memory allocations and deallocations, impacting performance.

It's important to note that the impact of these features on latency can vary depending on the specific use case, system requirements, and optimization efforts. Analyzing the performance characteristics of your system, profiling, and benchmarking are crucial steps to identify and mitigate any potential performance bottlenecks.

# Linux kernel tuning for ultra low latency systems
CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT Patch: Applying the PREEMPT_RT patch to the kernel provides real-time capabilities, allowing critical tasks to preempt non-critical ones. This patch reduces latency by providing deterministic scheduling.

CONFIG_HZ: This configuration option sets the kernel timer frequency. Lowering the value of CONFIG_HZ increases the timer interrupt frequency, providing more precise timekeeping and reducing latency.

CONFIG_SCHED_AUTOGROUP: Disabling this option prevents the kernel from automatically grouping processes and can improve latency by reducing scheduling overhead.

CONFIG_NO_HZ_FULL: Enabling this option reduces timer interrupts on idle CPUs, conserving power and reducing latency.

CONFIG_CPU_IDLE: Configuring CPU idle states appropriately can optimize power management while ensuring low latency. Consider selecting the appropriate CPU idle governors based on your system requirements.

CONFIG_SCHED_MC: Enabling this option improves scheduling efficiency on systems with multiple CPUs by minimizing task migration, which can help reduce latency.

CONFIG_NET_RX_BUSY_POLL: Activating this option allows busy polling for network packets, reducing latency by avoiding interrupt-driven network processing.

CONFIG_NET_DMA: Configuring DMA (Direct Memory Access) options for network interfaces can optimize data transfer and reduce latency. Depending on your hardware, you may need to adjust the DMA settings accordingly.

CONFIG_IPV4_TCP_RETRANSMIT_TIMEOUT: Adjusting this parameter can help optimize TCP retransmission timeouts, which can impact latency in network communication.

CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS: Enabling high-resolution timers provides more accurate timekeeping and can reduce latency in time-sensitive operations.

It's important to note that kernel tuning for ultra-low-latency systems requires careful consideration and should be performed with expert knowledge. The specific tuning options may vary depending on your system requirements and hardware configuration. It is recommended to consult kernel documentation, relevant resources, and seek expert guidance when performing kernel tuning for ultra-low-latency systems.
